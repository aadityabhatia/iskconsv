<h1>Motel Sankirtana</h1>
Srila Prabhupada said this in a letter to Jananivasa Prabhu, 5 March 1971:
<blockquote>Our book distribution program is most important work. Anyone reading our Krsna book,
	TLC, NOD, and Bhagvad Gita As It Is, is sure to become a Krishna Conscious person. Therefore
	somehow or other we must push on this literature distribution program, either through schools,
	colleges, libraries, life membership program or ordinary sales.</blockquote>

<h1>Introduction to Motel Sankirtana</h1>
<p>ISKCON of Silicon Valley ("ISV") has recently started a program of placing soft bound English
	language editions of Bhagavad Gita in hotel/motel rooms, similar to the placing of Holy Bibles
	by the Gideons. We started this "Pancajanya Project" in April 2008, primarily in the San
	Francisco Bay Area, but we have already received a great deal of very positive feedback from
	owners and guests alike. We have therefore decided to expand the program. </p>

<h1>Placing Bhagavad Gita at Motels</h1>
<p>Any owners willing to participate merely have to contact ISV. We will then deliver the books
	to their establishments and follow up at later dates for further restocking.</p>
<p>We have already placed many thousands of Bhagavad Gitas, and are now poised to expand the
	program geometrically. We have already placed Bhagavad Gitas in rooms of the following chains,
	among others:</p>
<p>Some of the chains of hotels where we have already placed the Bhagavad Gita :</p>
<ul>
	<li>Howard Johnson (San Mateo)&#8207;</li>
	<li>Holiday Inn (San Mateo)&#8207;</li>
	<li>Quality Inn (South San Francisco)&#8207;</li>
	<li>Best Western (Milpitas)&#8207;</li>
	<li>Days Inn (San Bruno)&#8207;</li>
	<li>Comfort Inn (San Mateo)&#8207;</li>
	<li>Super 8 (San Mateo)&#8207;</li>
</ul>
<p>We are fortunate to have Dilip Patel Prabhu in our congregation. We have used Dilip Prabhu's
	contacts to start the &#8220;Panchajanya Project&#8221;. We contact individual motel owners and
	tell them about the program.Prominent motel owners, especially the Patels, have whole-heartedly
	welcomed and supported this program.We now aspire to contact motel owners through asscoaitions.
	This would enable us to reach a wider target audience. Hopefully, we will be able to get some
	breakthrough very soon. </p>
<p>
	We request all of you to join us in this service to aSrila Prabhupada.</p>
<p>We humbly request all motel/hotel owners assistance in this great cultural and spiritual
	project. There are various ways in which motel owners can participate: </p>
<ol>
	<li>Kindly allow us to place Bhagavad Gita at your motels.</li>
	<li>Help us get an entry for a presentation at any convention, 'Gaam' meeting or any other Motel
		owners get together. This will enable us to present the cause to a wider audience.</li>
	<li>As a motel owner, use your contacts to place Bhagavad Gita at other motels, i.e Use your
		sphere of influence to further place this holy book at other organizations.</li>
	<li>If possible, we would also like to submit articles or advertisements publicizing our
		activities in motel newsletters, magazines, websites, emails or similar publications. We can
		submit articles or photo-ready ads to meet whatever guidelines required.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, anyone and everyone can help by donations. 'The Gideon Bible' is placed free at all
	motels and hence most motel owners have similar expectations for 'The Bhagavad Gita, as it is'.
	By your donation, people in general benefit by getting a chance to read about Krishna, and you
	directly participate in the preaching mission of Sri Krishna Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Srila
	Prabhupada. Your help increases book distribution, which is the highest welfare work for all
	humanity.Donations to this project are fully tax deductible. </p>
<p>
	In addition, if you have any ideas or suggestions as to how ISKCON of Silicon Valley can improve
	or expand this noble effort, we would greatly appreciate hearing them. Kindly mail them to
	<a href="mailto: milan.doshi@gmail.com">milan.doshi@gmail.com</a>
	. We look forward to receiving your suggestions.
