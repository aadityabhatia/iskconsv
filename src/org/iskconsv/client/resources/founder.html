<h1>His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada</h1>
<h2>Founder-Acarya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness</h2>
<p>Srila Prabhupada took birth in this world on the day after Krishna's 
	appearance day, in Calcutta, 1896. His life history from his earliest 
	days to his passing away in 1977 is vividly described in his authorized 
	biography, the Srila Prabhupada Lilamrta.</p>
<p>In Calcutta, 1922, Srila Prabhupada first met his spiritual master, 
	Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur, who immediately asked him, 
	"You are an intelligent young man. Why don't you preach the 
	message of Lord Caitanya in English?" This request was to be 
	the driving force in Srila Prabhupada's life.</p>
<p>Although Srila Prabhupada then accepted his spiritual master within 
	his heart, it was in 1932 that he became Srila Bhaktisiddhanta's 
	officially initiated disciple. Meanwhile, Srila Prabhupada had started 
	a successful pharmaceutical business to maintain his family.</p>
<p>In 1936, Srila Prabhupada wrote to his spiritual master, who was 
	then passing his last days on the planet. In the letter Prabhupada 
	asked, "Is there any particular service I can do?" Srila 
	Bhaktisiddhanta said in his reply, "I am fully confident that 
	you can explain in English our thoughts and arguments. ...I have 
	every hope that you can turn yourself into a very good English preacher." 
	Srila Prabhupada knew this was to be his life's mission, and he 
	began to prepare himself.</p>
<p>In 1944, during the Second World War, when paper was scarce and 
	people were not very wealthy materially or spiritually, Srila Prabhupada 
	began his magazine, Back to Godhead, which is still being published 
	today. To pay for the printing, he would collect donations. To publish 
	the issues (then in newspaper format), he would write, edit, and 
	do the layout. To sell them, he would go out himself.</p>
<p>In 1950, he left his home and family and dedicated his life to 
	preaching. In 1959, he took the order of sannyasa -- full renunciation 
	from material life. Soon afterward he wrote three volumes of the 
	Srimad Bhagavatam, finishing the first of twelve cantos. Again he 
	wrote, edited, proofread, bought the paper, and got the books printed 
	and bound. After delivery, he sold the books through bookstores 
	and agents in the larger cities of India.</p>
<p>Now he had these three books in English. Feeling the weight of 
	his spiritual master's order and knowing Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu's 
	assurance that His holy name would be heard in every town and village 
	throughout the world, Srila Prabhupada was determined to go to America 
	somehow or other and preach. He was convinced that if the Americans 
	would take up Krishna consciousness, all the other countries in 
	the world would follow.</p>
<p>Begging passage on the Jaladuta, a cargo carrier of the Scindia 
	Steamship Corporation, and traveling 35 painful days across the 
	ocean (he had two heart attacks on the journey), Srila Prabhupada 
	arrived in New York City. He later related, "I didn't know 
	where to turn, left or right." After a difficult six months, 
	living here and there, he rented a small storefront on 26 Second 
	Avenue in New York's Lower East Side, not the best neighborhood 
	by any estimation. It was here that some sincere searchers for spiritual 
	knowledge gathered and gradually found shelter at the lotus feet 
	of Srila Prabhupada, whom they affectionately called, "Swamiji."</p>
<p>Soon Srila Prabhupada gathered the most interested of these searchers 
	and brought them to Tompkins Square Park, where they held the first 
	outdoor chanting session (sankirtan) outside India. Onlookers were 
	amazed, and the boys who had gone with him were feeling the ecstasy 
	of chanting. Soon there were regular chanting parties, and the first 
	devotees became initiated by Srila Prabhupada. In July of 1966, 
	Srila Prabhupada officially incorporated The International Society 
	for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) and began to develop his infrastructure 
	for spreading the message of Krishna throughout the world. Srila 
	Prabhupada revived his Back to Godhead magazine, which the newly-initiated 
	devotees distributed on the streets.</p>
<p>Regularly Srila Prabhupada would hold chanting sessions and give 
	lectures to the eager groups of people who would come to his storefront. 
	Always he would distribute prasadam, and soon he started the first 
	Sunday feasts.</p>
<p>After the New York devotees became more steady in their spiritual 
	practice, Srila Prabhupada went to San Francisco to establish ISKCON 
	on the West Coast of the USA. Many hippies joined his movement and 
	spread spiritual love and peace throughout the community. Srila 
	Prabhupada sent his disciples to preach in other parts of the world 
	and establish Krishna Conscious centers. They first started preaching 
	in London, then later in Berlin, India, and many cities throughout 
	the USA.</p>
<p>Srila Prabhupada passed away from this world in 1977. After preaching 
	for 11 years in the West, he had created 108 centers worldwide, 
	written 51 volumes of transcendental literature (described below), 
	traveled around the world eight times and initiated 5,000 disciples. 
	He had created the world's largest publisher of Vedic literature 
	(The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust), a scientific preaching academy (The 
	Bhaktivedanta Institute), and many other trusts to insure the continuity 
	of ISKCON.</p>
