<blockquote>
harer nama harer nama <br/>
harer namaiva kevalam <br/>
kalau nasty eva nasty eva <br/>
nasty eva gatir anyatha <br/>
 <br/>
In this age of quarrel and hypocrisy the only means of deliverance is chanting the holy name of the Lord. There is no other way. There is no other way. There is no other way.
