<p>In this program, we take a verse from Bhagavad-Gita (an anciet timeless wisdom) and discuss its personal application in our day to day lives. In history, there have been great leaders like Mahatma Gandi, Henry Thoreau who have extolled the glories of this ancient book of wisdom.</p>
<p>This is a very nice forum to discuss many personal impediments and seek a holistic solution. We also get to understand more deeper aspects of our existence, our relationship with nature and other living entities. The program is intended to provide a vision and a direction for our lives.</p>
