<h1>Organization</h1>
<p>The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) was established in 1966 by His
	Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada (Srila Prabhupada). ISKCON has since developed
	into a worldwide confederation of 6,000 temple devotees and 190,000 congregational devotees.</p>
<p>Better known as the Hare Krishna movement, ISKCON is comprised of more than 350 centers, 60
	rural communities, 50 schools and 60 restaurants worldwide.</p>
<p>The mission of this nonsectarian, monotheistic movement is to promote the well being of society
	by teaching the science of Krishna consciousness according to the Bhagavad Gita and other ancient
	Vedic scriptures of India.</p>

<h1>Mission</h1>
<p>Srila Prabhupada gave a clear mission statement for ISKCON which is outlined in the following
	seven points:</p>
<ol>
	<li>To systematically propagate spiritual knowledge to society at large and to educate all people
in the techniques of spiritual life in order to check the imbalance of values in life and to
achieve real unity and peace in the world.</li>
	<li>To propagate a consciousness of Krishna (God), as it is revealed in the great scriptures of
India, Bhagavad-gita and Srimad Bhagavatam.</li>
	<li>To bring the members of the Society together with each other and nearer to Krishna, the prime
entity, thus developing the idea within the members, and humanity at large, that each soul is
part and parcel of the quality of Godhead (Krishna).</li>
	<li>To teach and encourage the sankirtana movement, congregational chanting of the holy name of
God, as revealed in the teachings of Lord Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.</li>
	<li>To erect for the members and for society at large a holy place of transcendental pastimes
dedicated to the personality of Krishna.</li>
	<li>To bring the members closer together for the purpose of teaching a simpler, more natural way
of life.</li>
	<li>With a view towards achieving the aforementioned purposes, to publish and distribute
periodicals, magazines, books and other writings.</li>
</ol>

<h1>History</h1>
<p>The International Society for Krishna Consciousness is a denomination of the Gaudiya Vaishnava
	faith, a devotional tradition based on the teachings of Bhagavad-gita and the Bhagavat Purana
	(Srimad Bhagavatam). The tradition traces its roots back 5,000 years.</p>
<p>The precepts and practises of the members of the present day ISKCON were taught and codified by
	the 15th century saint and religious reformer Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu and his principle
	associates, the six Goswamis of Vrindavana.</p>
<p>Sri Caitanya, whom devotees revere as a direct incarnation of Krishna, gave a powerful impetus
	for a massive bhakti (devotional) movement of Krishna followers throughout India. It was under
	his direction that hundreds of volumes of books on the philosophy of Krishna consciousness were
	compiled. The movement diminished somewhat until the 19th century, when a outstanding Vaisnava
	theologian, Bhaktivinoda Thakura, again revived Krishna consciousness.</p>
<p>His son, Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Goswami, became the guru of Srila Prabhupada and instructed
	him to make the spreading of Krishna consciousness in the West the mission of his life. In 1965,
	after spending 43 years of his life preparing for the journey, Srila Prabhupada came to America
	to spread the Krishna philosophy. On July 11, 1966, ISKCON was officially registered in New York
	state, and thus began the Hare Krishna movement in the West.</p>

<h1>Philosophy</h1>
<p>The Vedic scriptures state that spiritual life begins when one inquires into the nature of the
	absolute truth, the Supreme Godhead. Gaudiya Vaisnavas are monotheists and know the personality
	of Godhead as Krishna, the All-attractive. But it is also recognized that the Supreme has
	unlimited names such as Rama, Buddha, Vishnu, Jehovah, Allah, etc. The ultimate goal of Gaudiya
	Vaisnavism is to develop a loving relationship with the Supreme Godhead.</p>
<p>The Vedas also tell us that the understanding of the self, as being non-material or spiritual
	by nature, is the preliminary stage of realization of the absolute truth. To understand knowledge
	of self-realization one must approach a genuine spiritual master, just as one learns the essence
	of any subject from a perfected practitioner.</p>
<p>The congregational chanting of the maha-mantra, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna,
	Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, as promoted by Sri Caitanya, is accepted
	by the Vedas as the most effective means of self-purification in this age. The Vedas describe the
	mantra as a prayer to the Lord, "Please Lord, engage me in Your service".</p>
<p>Devotees may accept formal initiation into the chanting of the Holy Name vowing to abstain from
	intoxication, gambling, illicit sexual connections and the eating of meat, fish or eggs. ISKCON
	members believe indulgence in the aforementioned activities disrupts physical, mental and
	spiritual well-being, and increases anxiety and conflict in society. At the time of initiation
	devotees also agree to chant a prescribed number of mantras each day. </p>
