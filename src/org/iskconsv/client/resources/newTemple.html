<p>ISKCON of Silicon Valley is pleased to announce the initiation of its fund raising drive
	for the establishment of a new temple for Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
	The present ISKCON temple, the Sri Sri Radha Madan-Mohan Temple in West San Jose, needs to
	relocate to a new site in order to accommodate the rapidly growing congregation of Krishna
	devotees in the South Bay.</p>
<p>The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) was founded by His Divine
	Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Its mission is to promote the well being of
	society by teaching the science of Krishna Consciousness according to the Bhagavad Gita and
	other ancient Vedic scriptures of India. It is a cultural movement for the spiritualization
	of human society.</p>
<p>The mission of ISKCON of Silicon Valley is To show mercy to all living beings by
	distributing the holy names of Krishna.</p>
<p>For the past six years, ISKCON devotees of Silicon Valley have been congregating for
	worship in the Radha Madan-Mohan Temple in a storefront in West San Jose. Although this site
	has served the congregation well, it is a rental facility with limited space to accommodate
	the needs of a rapidly expanding congregation of devotees. Furthermore, since the site is on
	a lease, the devotees desire that Lord Krishna have a place of His own where they can be
	permanently housed.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the purpose of this fund-raising drive is to raise sufficient funds to
	establish a new and permanent temple for Lord Krishna in the Silicon Valley. Our goal is to
	raise 1.5 Million Dollars to successfully accomplish this project. The new temple would
	serve as a center of ISKCON of Silicon Valley and provide a permanent place of worship for
	devotees of Lord Krishna. Additionally, it would offer to you and your family: devotional
	service, kirtan, Deity worship, prasadam and education in Krishna consciousness.</p>
