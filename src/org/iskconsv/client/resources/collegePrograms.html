Srila prabhupad purport in Srimad-Bhagavatam 7.6.24 mentions
<blockquote>
	“Preaching is the best service to the Lord. The Lord will immediately be extremely satisfied
	with one who engages in this service of preaching Krishna consciousness. This is confirmed by
	the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-Gita(18.69). Na ca tasmat manusyesu kascin me priya-krttamah.
	"There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there ever be one more
	dear." If one sincerely tries his best to spread Krishna consciousness by preaching the glories
	of the Lord and His supremacy, even if he is imperfectly educated, he becomes the dearmost
	servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is bhakti. As one performs this service for humanity, without discrimination between friends and enemies,
	the Lord becomes satisfied, and the mission of one's life is fulfilled.”
